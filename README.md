### Why 2024 Looks Quiet
While 2024 may seem inactive on my GitHub, itâ€™s been a very productive year! I completed an internship and worked on my thesis project for **Novo Nordisk**. During this time, all development took place on their internal systems and computers, which is why itâ€™s not reflected here.

At Novo Nordisk, I focused on projects involving **data engineering**, **mobile app development**, and **NFC technology**. These experiences have improved my skills in software development and problem-solving in a professional environment.

Now, Iâ€™m ready to take on new challenges. ðŸš€
